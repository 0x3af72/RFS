# RFS

RFS is an easy to use file vault to securely store your files. It can be used on your computer, or from an external drive.

Data on external drives is accessible to anyone, so private files can be stored on them with RFS.

## Security

**Hashing**: Passwords are hashed with SHA256 and salted with a 32-character salt.

**Encryption**: Files are encrypted with AES-256, a secure encryption algorithm.

## Functionalities

Users are able to:

 - 🔒📁 *Store, delete and export* files and folders 
 - 🔎 *Display all files* in current directory 
 - ➡️ *Move* into and out of folders 
 - 📝 *Open files* (read only) 
 - 🔑 *Change their password*
